# grcMalaria
<b>R Package for processing and analyzing SpotMalaria Genetic Report Cards</b>

Welcome to the grcMalaria R package!
<br/>This software package is intended for processing data files in the Genetic Report Card (GRC) format, generated by genetic surveillance of malaria projects such as GenRe-Mekong. With a small number of simple R commads, the grcMalaria library generates maps of prevalence, allele proportions, diversity and clustering, as well as genetic epidemiology analyses such as PCA and nighbour-joining trees.

We have provided a User Guide as well as video tutorials to show how to make use of the grcMalaria package.
<br/>The User Guide is available at https://genremekong.org/tools/grcmalaria-r-package-user-guide

The grcMalaria R package requires R version 4 or higher; you can freely install it from https://www.r-project.org/.
<br/>It has no special hardware requirements and can run on most current dektops/laptops on Windows, Mac or Linux.
<br/>Refer to the User Guide for instructions on how to install the grcMalaria package: installation only takes a few minutes, and you will need an Internet connection.
<br/>The User Guide will point you to a GRC dataset you can use to follow the tutorials; for every feature you will be shown how to invoke it, what parameters to use and what outputs will be generated. The creation of most maps takes only a few seconds on most desktops/laptops.
