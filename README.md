# grcMalaria
<b>R Package for processing and analyzing SpotMalaria Genetic Report Cards</b>

Welcome to the grcMalaria R package!
<br/>This software package is intended for processing data files in the Genetic Report Card (GRC) format, generated by genetic surveillance of malaria projects such as GenRe-Mekong. With a small number of simple R commands, the grcMalaria library generates maps of prevalence, allele proportions, diversity and clustering, as well as genetic epidemiology analyses such as PCA and nighbour-joining trees.

## User Guide
We have provided a User Guide as well as video tutorials to show how to make use of the grcMalaria package.
<br/>The User Guide is available at [https://genremekong.org/tools/grcmalaria-guide](https://genremekong.org/tools/grcmalaria-guide)

You may also want to watch the videos from our Training Workshop, available at https://genremekong.org/knowledge/training-workshop.
